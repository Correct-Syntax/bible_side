He told them that it's Yeshua who made everything around us, therefore he's greater than the angels and other unseen powers. He also saw the godliness of his father, and there's no other source of life for believers other than him. So then it's necessary that the believers don't follow human customs and traditions, but rather, it's necessary that they simply follow the messiah."
