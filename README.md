[Bibleside](https://bibleside.com) is an offline Bible app featuring the OET (Open English Translation).

The [OET (Open English Translation)](https://openenglishtranslation.bible) is a new, open-licensed Bible translation (currently in ``draft`` state) featuring multiple versions intended to be used together. Read it [here](https://openenglishtranslation.bible/Reader). <sup>Please see the OET website for more info on what makes it different than other translations.</sup>

Bibleside implements the OET's "Reader's" version in the main area and a toggle to show the "Literal" and "Reader's" versions side-by-side. The two can be scrolled together for easy comparison.

## Roadmap

[Bibleside Roadmap](https://github.com/users/Correct-Syntax/projects/2/views/7)


## Note on Bible versions

Bible versions are treated as separate Bibles. e.g: The OET-RV and OET-LV are treated as a separate bible version.


## Updating the OET

There is a Python script in ``/assets/bibles`` that will automatically update the json files from the GitHub sources.

The ESFM (a subset of USFM) files from [here (OET Reader's version)](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/OpenEnglishTranslation--OET/tree/main/translatedTexts/ReadersVersion) and [here (OET Literal version)](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/OpenEnglishTranslation--OET/tree/main/intermediateTexts/auto_edited_VLT_ESFM) are run through [usfm-grammar](https://github.com/Bridgeconn/usfm-grammar) for conversion to JSON (USJ).

Navigate to ``/assets/bibles`` and run the file with ``python update_OET_json.py``.


## Updating the OET sections

After converting the OET ESFM to json, navigate to the folder with ``cd assets/bibles`` and run ``python update_OET_sections.py``. This will generate a dart file mapping the OET sections for use in Bibleside. Move back to the root folder with ``cd ../..`` and run ``dart format ./lib -l 120`` to format the file.


## Updating the WEB

There is a Python script in ``/assets/bibles`` that will update the json files for the WEB. Since the WEB (The World English Translation) is complete, updating would only be to fix typos, etc. See the ``update_WEB_json.py`` file for instructions.
